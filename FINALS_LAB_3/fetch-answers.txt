Answer the following:

1. What are the main differences between XMLHttpRequest and 
Fetch API?
Answer: XMLHttpRequest uses a callback-based approach, which can lead 
to messy, nested code, while the Fetch API relies on Promises, 
making asynchronous code cleaner and easier to manage. Fetch also 
provides a more modern structure that simplifies chaining and readability.

In terms of error handling, XHR requires manually checking status codes, 
while Fetch only rejects on network errors. HTTP errors in Fetch still 
resolve normally, so developers need to verify response.ok to confirm 
if the request was successful.

Fetch supports more modern web features such as streaming and smoother 
integration with tools like Service Workers, while XHR lacks many of 
these capabilities. Both can cancel requests, but XHR has built-in 
progress events, whereas Fetch uses AbortController and does not provide 
native progress tracking.

2. Why is the Fetch API considered more modern and readable?
Answer: The Fetch API is a modern alternative to XMLHttpRequest for 
making HTTP requests in JavaScript. It is considered more readable 
and intuitive because it uses Promises, which simplify asynchronous 
code and eliminate the nested callbacks common with XHR.


3. What is the purpose of the .then() and .catch() methods in Fetch?
Answer: The .then() method runs a callback when a Promise is 
successfully fulfilled, handling the retrieved data. The .catch() 
method runs a callback when a Promise is rejected or an error occurs, 
handling any failures in the request or previous .then() blocks.


4. What happens when you send a POST request to the placeholder API?
Answer: When you send a POST request to the JSONPlaceholder API, 
it doesn’t actually save your data because it’s a fake API. Instead, 
it simulates creating a new post by returning a response that 
includes the data you sent along with a new post ID, usually 101, so 
you can confirm your “post” was successfully received. It’s perfect 
for testing without affecting a real database.
