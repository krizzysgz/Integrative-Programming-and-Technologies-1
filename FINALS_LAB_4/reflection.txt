1. What are the basic rules of XML you applied in this lab?
Answer: In this lab, I made sure every tag has an opening and 
closing pair, all tags are properly nested, and the document 
starts with a single root element. I also kept the syntax clean 
and consistent so it’s easy to read and validate.

2. Why does XML need a single root element?
Answer: XML needs one root element because it’s like the 
“container” for all the other data. Without it, the structure 
would be messy and computers wouldn’t know where the data starts 
or ends.

3. How does XML ensure interoperability?
Answer: XML ensures interoperability because it’s plain text with a 
clear structure that any system or program can read. As long as the 
rules are followed, different software can understand and exchange 
the data easily.
